This is the proto-README for xmlresolver

Summary:	An enhanced XML resolver with XML Catalog support
License:	GNU General Public License (GPL v. 2.0)

The xmlresolver project provides an advanced implementation of the SAX
EntityResolver, the Transformer URIResolver, and a new
NamespaceResolver. The implementation uses the OASIS XML Catalogs V1.1
Standard to provide a mapping from public identifiers to local
resources.

In addition to enhanced support for RDDL-based namespace resolution,
the implementation supports automatic local caching of resources. This
provides the advantages of the catalog specification without requiring
users to manage the mapping by hand.

Applications can use the resolver directly or they can instantiate one
of a set of convenience classes to access parsers that automatically
implement these resolvers.

The goal of this project is to produce a clean, reasonably simple API
and a robust, thread-safe implementation. At this time, the code is
probably neither completely baked nor entirely robust. Please consider
it "beta" for the time being.
